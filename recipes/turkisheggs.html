        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>1 cup plain Greek yogurt</ul>
        <ul>1 to 2 garlic cloves (finely minced)</ul>
        <ul>2 eggs</ul>
        <ul>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</ul>
        <ul>2 teaspoons Aleppo peppers (or red pepper flakes)</ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>In a small mixing bowl, combine the room-temp yogurt and garlic, 
            a good pinch of kosher salt and whisk well. Divide the yogurt mixture 
            between two serving bowls and set aside for now.</ol>
        <ol>Bring a medium saucepan full of water to a boil. Stir in the 
            vinegar.</ol>
        <ol>Meanwhile, crack an egg into a small fine mesh sieve over a small 
            bowl. Gently swirl the eggs in the sieve to drain the liquidy part 
            of the egg whites (this gives you a neater-looking poached egg). 
            Transfer the egg to a ramekin.</ol>
        <ol>When the water is ready, using a wooden spoon, stir the water to create a 
            vortex. Quickly add the egg to the middle of vortex and cook for 2 to 3 
            minutes. When ready, using a slotted spoon, transfer the egg to a 
            plate that has been lined with parchment paper.</ol>
        <ol>Prepare and cook the second egg exactly as you did the first.</ol>
        <ol>While the second egg is cooking, quickly make the olive oil sauce. 
            In a small skillet, warm the olive oil and Aleppo pepper over medium 
            heat.</ol>
        <ol>Immediately transfer the poached eggs to the prepared yogurt bowls
            (simply place each egg on top of the yogurt mixture) and drizzle 
            with the heated oil.</ol>
        <ol>Serve immediately with your favorite rustic bread. </ol>
