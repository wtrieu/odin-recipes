        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>1 (32 ounce) can of whole tomatoes, drained</ul>
        <ul>1 cup fresh basil leaves, washed and spun dry</ul>
        <ul>4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</ul>
        <ul>6 cloves garlic, peeled</ul>
        <ul>2 large French baguettes, sliced 1-inch thick (~36 slices)</ul>
        <ul>1 1/2 pounds fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced 1/4-inch thick</ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.</ol>
        <ol>2. In the bowl of a food processor, add drained tomatoes, 1 cup basil leaves, olive oil and 2 cloves garlic. Pulse until smooth, but somewhat chunky. Season with salt and pepper.</ol>
        <ol>3. On a baking sheet, line up baguette slices. Toast in oven for about 3 minutes or until light golden brown. Working quickly, rub the remaining garlic on the toasted side of each slice and then lay a piece of mozzarella cheese on top. Place bread back in oven and melt cheese slightly, about 45 seconds. Remove from oven and spread one tablespoon of the tomato mixture on each piece.</ol>
        <ol>4. Place bruschetta on decorative platter and garnish with basil leaves.</ol>
