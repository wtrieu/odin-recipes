        <ul>
            <li>1 lb Bok Choy or Baby Bok Choy</li>
            <li>8 oz King Oyster Mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>4 slices of ginger</li>
            <li>Water for blanching</li>
            <li>Oil for cooking</li>
            <li><strong>Sauce:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon 'oyster' sauce</li>
                <li>½ cup water with 2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the bok choy: Quartered or halved the bok choy. Clean bok choy to remove dirt.</li>
            <li>To blanch the bok choy, fill a tall pot or wok with water and bring it to a rolling boil. Then, add a drizzle of oil and season with some salt.</li>
            <li>Blanch bok choy for about a minute. Remove bok choy and shake off excess water, then transfer them to a cleaned plate.</li>
            <li>Heat up a large wok and add about 1 tablespoon of oil.</li>
            <li>Sauté ginger until fragrant and add in the mushrooms. Continue to stir-fry until mushrooms release their aroma or turn slightly golden.</li>
            <li>Add in the bok choy and vegan 'oyster' sauce.</li>
            <li>Stir-fry bok choy for 1-2 minutes and season if needed (adjust the time depending on the amount you have and the size of the bok choy).</li>
            <li>Finally, stir in the cornstarch slurry and toss everything until well-combined and cook until the sauce is thickened. Remove from the heat and serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
